# nanoColBERT

This repo provides a simple implementation of [ColBERT-v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12832) model.

The official github repo: [Link](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT) (v1 branch)

ColBERT is a powerful late-interaction model that could perform both retrieval and reranking.

## Get Started
```
conda create -n nanoColBERT python=3.8 && conda activate nanoColBERT
## install torch and faiss according to your CUDA version
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
Configure `wandb` and `accelerate`
```bash
wandb login
accelerate config
```
After everything setup, just launch the whole process with:

(if the download link is expired, please refer to https://github.com/Hannibal046/nanoColBERT/issues/5, https://github.com/Hannibal046/nanoColBERT/issues/2)
```bash
bash scripts/download.sh
bash scripts/run_colbert.sh
```
It would first download the data, preprocess the data, train the model, index with faiss, conduct retrieval and calculate the score.

## Pretrained Ckpt
We also provide our trained model on the Huggingface Space and you could simply use it with:
```python
from model import ColBERT
from transformers import BertTokenizer

pretrained_model = "nanoColBERT/ColBERTv1"
model = ColBERT.from_pretrained(pretrained_model)
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(pretrained_model) 
```
